# Noah's Professional Portfolio - Advanced CSS
Challenge 02 - Advanced CSS

## Description
I built this project so that I could have a website that can hold my future projects that I work on. I also built this project in order to showcase my knowledge and understanding of some of the advanced CSS principles that we have learned lately in class. I demonstrated my ability to create css variables, use flexboxes, and use media quieries. I also demonstrated my ability to build a webpage by scratch using html and css, including other things like css hover effects and css border manipulation.

When building this I learned the importance of CSS and how it can be used to make or break a good webpage that stands out from others. CSS is also critical when it comes to creating a webpage that can function well on devices of all shapes and sizes.

## Installation
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
This project can be used for housing the side projects that I have/will create. It will serve as a personal portfolio that can be shared with others to showcase my skills and the different types of things I have worked on.
